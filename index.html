                                                Good childhood is about love, understanding, passion, security, demanding and inspiring to growth. 
                                                In every continent, in every country the needs of children are uncovered, sometimes even unnoticed. 
                                                Where there is the lack of sense, egocentrism, dazzling consumption or lonely emptiness, 
                                                we believe that the world needs more love that blossoms when it’s shared. Paradoxically, 
                                                we all need to be the ones to receive, and to give - in order to develop our humanity.

                                            <p>We feel that we are so small like a mosquito, but our desire to share what we have empowers us
                                                to forget about our limits and think more about a small difference we can make, together with you.

                                                JUSTYNA managed to work with a few most vulnerable small humans who suffer from hunger, disabilities and the world’s indifference 
                                                in different parts of the world. So today she wants to connect people from different homes and continents, inspire them to contribute 
                                                to small changes in concrete lives and explain why sharing is what the world needs. What children need. She is a founder of the organization and a head full of ideas.

                                                now they want to share their skills with children. KASIA spent her last 10 years in Human Resources as a trainer in communication, 
                                                creativity and talent management. Although she has impressive experience and background, her biggest satisfaction is to help people
                                                excel their self-consciousness and develop their skills. Luckily, her desire to do something for children is supported by her husband
                                                Tomasz who is ready to contribute to our foundation with his passion for sport and IT business. He already made our logo – isn’t it beautiful?

                                                We have a mother of three small kids that apart from taking care of her own family is creating projects for children and youth in her neighbourhood.
                                                When she stops cooking, washing, cleaning and playing with children she tries to find some to make them love science more (and school). 
                                                How? By teaching and demonstrating various experiments than can bring a lot of profit in daily life (making natural cosmetics). 
                                                Oh yes, and in the meantime ASIA is about to finish her PhD in chemistry. Let’s keep our fingers crossed for her, she needs it!

                                        <p><b><i>Why children?</i></b></p>
                                        <p>First of all, we believe we are still world children, sometimes lost on the way, sometimes hurt. We are hiding in our adolescence 
                                            forgetting who we are, what were our dreams, needs and desires when we were a child.

                                            Second of all, children are the hope of our world. At the same time, they are the most vulnerable creatures that are shaped 
                                            in a great extend by us adults. While some children in XXI century still don’t have access to drinking water, suffer 
                                            from hunger while others have too many smartphones and rooms full of clothes they have never worn, there is one 
                                            prevailing conclusion - all that children need our care and directions that can make them develop into good, wise and valuable humans.

                                            We believe that children should be raised for a self-reliant citizens of the world and equipped with 
                                            concrete tools that will enable them to create not only scientific solutions for global challenges, 
                                            but most of all not let them forget what it means to be a human being at first side. To do so, we want 
                                            to make sure that ethical and moral development in the current societies won’t be neglected. Also, we want 
                                            children to know how to build social interactions and take responsibility for themselves and others as well. 
                                            How to remain a human being in the era of AI, automation, cyber crimes and social media challenges. 
                                            We don’t more children to suffer from depression, low self-esteem and lack of relations with authorities.

                                            Our vision is to work on a holistic approach of human development. We believe that if we provide children 
                                            with education that would embrace: mind, spirit, psychology and physicality, the youth being equipped with 
                                            the tools to build healthy and human society will better tackle challenges, that we know already today that 
                                            are waiting for them today.

                                            Some of us still want to believe that what is behind the borders of our countries, behind our sight is 
                                            behind our mind and reality. However, such a mindset might turn out to be a trap for the next generations. 
                                            World is becoming the Pangea again, and in the old continent it is unprecedented that it happens in a peaceful way. 
                                            However, nothing is given us for granted and our children need a lot of qualities not only to live in that 
                                            context but also build it in a constructive, wise and peaceful manner. 
                                            Most urgently, children need to know how to find peace, love and fulfillment inside themselves.

                                            Doing several development projects in Africa, the founder of the Foundation found that the lack of qualitative 
                                            education in the rural areas is causing stagnation in growing populations and lack of progress. 
                                            Children in many African countries believe that education is the key and the future and we do we agree with them. 
                                            However, we know what kind of education can bring a real change.

                                            LibrAfrica project aims to equalize the development opportunities of children from rural areas in Africa and to 
                                            improve the quality of their education. Thanks to the access to development tools such as: books, maps, dictionaries, 
                                            logic, abstract and strategic games, instruments, computers - LibrAfrica strives to increase the level of knowledge, 
                                            but most importantly reading skills, critical, abstract and creative thinking that in a long perspective will improve 
                                            the quality of life among the poorest.

                                            tools for independent development of talents and predispositions regardless of the circumstances in which they were born.

                                            In 2018 we built and equipped the first LibrAfrica development center for children in Uganda. 
                                            In 2019 Justyna Jarząbska wrote a project that was financed by the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.polskapomoc.gov.pl/Polish,Aid,160.html" target="_blank"><b>Polish Aid Fund</b></a>

                                            more equipment and to open officially the library. Now, we are preparing the next LibrAfrica center for children 
                                            in Tanzania and on our map we have already next places to enhance children’s development.

                                            Through the EGN the IICD will serve as a platform for discussion on the situation in the country, 
                                            ensuring a child-centered and child-rights based holistic approach. Special consideration will therefore be 
                                            given to participation of unaccompanied children and former unaccompanied children.
